mean texture (standard deviation of grey-scale values)
mean perimeter
mean area
mean smoothness (is the local variation in radius lengths)
mean compactness (is the sq(perimeter) / area - 1.0)
mean concavity (is the severity of concave portions of the contour)
mean concave points (is the no: of concave portions of the contour)
mean symmetry 
mean fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
class shows the type .1-Malignant, 0-Benign
